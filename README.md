# TDD Starter Kit

This is a Starter Kit for my future Test-Driven Development projects.

## The Idea

The _master_ branch is just a basic branch. Each configuration used for different kinds of projects will get its own branch, always _rebased_ on _master_. This way, a project using TypeScript could be easily forked from this repository then have its _TypeScript_ branch merged on _master_. (The rest of the branches could be deleted if not needed.)
